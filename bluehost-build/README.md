# BlueHost Ready Deployment Package

This folder contains your website optimized specifically for BlueHost hosting.

## ✅ What's Fixed

- **Image Paths**: All image references now use `./images/` format
- **Folder Structure**: Images folder is lowercase to match BlueHost requirements
- **Case Sensitivity**: All paths are BlueHost-compatible
- **File Organization**: Clean structure ready for upload

## 🚀 How to Deploy

1. **Upload to BlueHost**:
   - Log into your BlueHost cPanel
   - Go to File Manager
   - Navigate to `public_html` directory
   - Upload ALL contents of this folder

2. **Maintain Structure**:
   - Keep the `images/` folder exactly as is (lowercase)
   - Don't rename any files
   - Preserve the folder hierarchy

3. **Set Permissions** (if needed):
   - Files: 644
   - Directories: 755

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **DO NOT** rename the `images` folder to `Images` (capital I)
- **DO NOT** modify the image paths in HTML files
- **DO** upload the entire contents of this folder to your `public_html` directory

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If images don't display after upload:
1. Check file permissions
2. Verify folder structure matches exactly
3. Clear browser cache
4. Refer to `BLUEHOST_DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed troubleshooting
